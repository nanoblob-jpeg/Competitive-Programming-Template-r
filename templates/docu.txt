type.conf
    This file should only be 1 line long
    The first line, should be the name of this group of templates. This is NOT needed in every directory.

parser.conf
    each new type is started by a line with only //!
    scheme is defined below, note it is all one tabbed to the right
    also, arguments can be in any order

    //!
    name, [one singular main name]
    desc, some short description
    alias, comma, separated, other aliases

    reserved type names
        parser path
        types


Hierarchy for listing:
    name(default) -> description

Can also list types:
    add list types
        will display the hierarchy of types that exist

    add list types name subname ... subsub..subname
        will display the hierarchy starting from that type name

Can also list only things under a certain type:
    add list [one of name|desc|alias] subname .. subsub..subname

For testing purposes, you can specify blocks to use in automated solutions by surrounding
//! test start [identifying string]
...
//! test end [identifying string]
