type.conf
    This file should only be 1 line long
    The first line, should be the name of this group of templates. This is NOT needed in every directory.

parser.conf
    each new type is started by a line with only //!
    scheme is defined below, note it is all one tabbed to the right
    also, arguments can be in any order and can appear multiple times

    //!
    main name, [one singular main name]
    alias, put, other, aliases, here , separated, by, commas
    list all, what to disply for listing all, separated by commas
    list some, what to disply for listing some, separated by commas
    list least, what to display for listing least
    list description, description without commas

    reserved type names
        parser path
        types


Hierarchy for listing:
    main name(default) -> alias -> least -> description -> some -> all
    When listing what templates exist the script will not search up this hierarchy to finds a config that exists
    but it will print out all of the ones that appear before in the list

    add list all
    add list alias
    add list least
    add list description
    add list some
    add list all

Can also list types:
    add list types
        will display the hierarchy of types that exist

    add list types name subname ... subsub..subname
        will display the hierarchy starting from that type name

notes:
    underscores replaced by spaces in argument list
    for listing, names will be converted to all uppercase

conventions for calling the tool:
when adding default inside of anywhere, at least for data structures, will put the templated class version
